# ImgProcessAPI
**Scripts Used :**
    "build": "npx tsc" >> 
    "jasmine": "jasmine"
    "test": "npm run build && npm run jasmine"
    "start": "nodemon src/server" 
    

**EndPoints :**
'/image'
then access image by URL parameters(name,width,height)

**Just a little note:**
while testing you will notice an error message because of function resize as it seems not working only while testing it process the image but to corupted type 
but that _JUST IN TESTING_ as if you test it manually you will find it working ,So I am really sorry I tried my best to figure out how to make it work but I didn't 
get to a solution.
Also I am sorry for being late to submit and Thanks in advance.
